This is a test suite for X.Org tests.

== Building the code ==
Required libraries:
 xorg-gtest: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/test/xorg-gtest/

Both of these are source libraries, but they need to be built and installed
for this repository to build.

=== Building xorg-gtest ===
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/testing
  make && make install

Notes:
* The repository must be installed for the pkg-config file to provide the
   right CFLAGS and include paths.

=== Building this repository ===
  export ACLOCAL_PATH="-I $HOME/testing/aclocal"
  export ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $ACLOCAL_PATH"
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/testing/lib/pkgconfig"
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/testing
  make

Notes:
* This repo does not need to be installed.

== Running the tests ==
Tests can be run by "make check", or one-by-one. 

Most tests start up some X server, so it is advisable to shut down any X
server on the test box. Some tests only start Xdummy, but do add
virtual input devices that may mess with the current session. Again, it is
advisable to shut down any X server on the test box.

For controlling test output (e.g. xml reporting), refer to
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/AdvancedGuide#Controlling_Test_Output

== Debugging test failures  ==
To run a subset of tests within a test case, filter on the test name. For
example,

        ./test-input-load --gtest_filter=InputDriverTest.DriverDevice/7

only runs the 7th test in the InputDriverTest/DriverDevice test case. Refer
to the googletest wiki for more information.
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/AdvancedGuide#Running_a_Subset_of_the_Tests

xorg-gtest supports the environment variable XORG_GTEST_XSERVER_SIGSTOP. If
set, the test will SIGSTOP itself once a server has been started. This,
allows to investigate logs or attach gdb to the server process.
