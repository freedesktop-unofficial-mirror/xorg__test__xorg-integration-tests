Writing test for the X.Org Integration Test (XIT) suite

== googletest ==
You should be familiar with googletest
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Documentation

This document well not detail googletest-only specific issues, it will focus
on those parts that are specific to XIT.

== Directory layout ==
Tests are divided by general category:
tests/input .... tests for specific input driver features or bugs
tests/video .... tests for specific video driver features or bugs
tests/server ... tests for server features or bugs
tests/lib ...... tests for library features or bugs

Each directory has a number of binaries that group the tests further. e.g.
server/grab is a set of grab-related tests. Tests should go into existing
binaries where sensible, but tests for new logical features should add new
binaries. A test binary may have multiple source files.

Ideally, each feature or behaviour group can be tested by running one
binary.

== Debugging tests ==
xorg-gtest supports three environment variables that help with debugging the
server.

Failing tests usually leave their config and log files around for
inspection. By default, this directory is /tmp (unless changed at configure
time with --with-logpath) and each test uses a naming convention that
includes TestCase.TestName.

Starting the same configuration as a failed test is thus
  Xorg -config /tmp/EvdevDriverFloatingSlaveTest.FloatingDevice

If tests fail because the server doesn't appear to start, you may set
  export XORG_GTEST_CHILD_STDOOUT=1
  sudo -E ./testname --gtest_filter="*blah*" # note the -E to sudo

If this variable is set, stdout from the server will go to stdout of your
test. It will be interleaved with the test output but nonetheless that's a
good way to identify failing server starts.

If you need to gdb the server to set breakpoints before a test starts, set
  export XORG_GTEST_XSERVER_SIGSTOP=1

The server will be sent a SIGSTOP signal after starting, waiting for you to
attach gdb. It can then be foregrounded and the test continues.
