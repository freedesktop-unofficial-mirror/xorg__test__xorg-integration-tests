Writing test for the X.Org Integration Test (XIT) suite

You should be familiar with googletest

This document well not detail googletest-only specific issues, it will focus
on those parts that are specific to XIT.

== Directory layout ==
Tests are divided by general category:
tests/input .... tests for specific input driver features or bugs
tests/video .... tests for specific video driver features or bugs
tests/server ... tests for server features or bugs
tests/lib ...... tests for library features or bugs

Each directory has a number of binaries that group the tests further. e.g.
server/grab is a set of grab-related tests. Tests should go into existing
binaries where sensible, but tests for new logical features should add new
binaries. A test binary may have multiple source files.

Ideally, each feature or behaviour group can be tested by running one
binary.
